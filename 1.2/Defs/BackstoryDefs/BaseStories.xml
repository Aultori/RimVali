    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] had a rough early adulthood. They were framed for a murder in [PAWN_possessive] pack back on Avalon, despite [PAWN_possessive] having no connection. The colony's leaders stated otherwise. [PAWN_nameDef] was banished from the pack, left alone to the worst parts of the Avalon tundra. Of course, the issue wasn't so much surviving, but the crippling loneliness, and the lack of food. Mirraciously, [PAWN_nameDef] found another pack after years of being alone, and slowly accustomed back to normal life. Being in complete isolation for years made it extremely hard to return to socializing, plus [PAWN_pronoun] didn't learn much technology-wise in the Avalon tundra.
	
	[PAWN_nameDef] swears to find the true murderer one day.</baseDescription>

[PAWN_nameDef] lives to serve the Illuminate, the Illuminate serves to grant livelihood to [PAWN_nameDef].
	
	If [PAWN_nameDef] wants something out of someone, [PAWN_pronoun] will get it, no matter the cost. It's not torture, it's coersion after all! [PAWN_nameDef] can play many roles, and can hold [PAWN_possessive] own in many situations.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] made [PAWN_possessive] living back on Avalon by petty thievery, shoplifting, and running black market goods. However, even those endeavours started to prove ineffective in fufilling [PAWN_nameDef]'s crave for possessions, so they then stepped up to muggings, kidnappings, ransom, robberies, and many more goodies.
	
	After a few years, [PAWN_nameDef] was caught, and placed into an Avali prisoner program. [PAWN_nameDef] is now being sent to a foreign planet for some kind of expedition, but [PAWN_pronoun] was too busy pickpocketing the instructor to really be listening.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] never really worked for anyone in particular, finding [PAWN_possessive] lifestyle in making, restoring, improving, changing, destroying, and designing countless odd machines. At home, [PAWN_pronoun] was disregarded for the bizarre creations [PAWN_pronoun] made, dismissed as being "absolutely impractical" and "having less worth then a wet dishrag." Nonetheless, [PAWN_nameDef] continued to hone their trade, developing many odd trinkets, even if [PAWN_nameDef] couldn't do [PAWN_possessive] dream designs such as "A giant robotic centipede with machine guns attached to it" or "A portable device that can generate tornadoes on command".

	But, this isn't Avalon anymore. Maybe [PAWN_nameDef]'s creations will finally be recognized for what they are worth on this new world?

    <titleShort>Miner Medic</titleShort>
    <baseDescription>On Avalon, mining is a crucial part of the economy, many basic Avali resources are based on precious rocks and metals found deep in caves or mountains. It also so happens that mining is an extremely dangerous job, and some people let the glowy rocks down below get to their heads; and that is not just a metaphor.
	
	[PAWN_nameDef]'s job entails digging into collapsed mining areas, and rescuing whoever is still alive. Sadly, it seems giant boulders usually beat Avali, but [PAWN_nameDef] has seen and dealt with quite a few different emergency situations, and is always ready for the next idiot who doesn't understand basic gravity.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] has been designing robotic replacements for body parts ever since a member of [PAWN_possessive] pack lost an arm, and [PAWN_pronoun] spent weeks trying different things to replace their arm. After weeks of jabbing new devices into the packmate's shoulder, one suddenly came to life, punching [PAWN_nameDef] square in the face. [PAWN_nameDef] has since then avoided actually installing the parts; they just wanna make them.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was the single Sheriff of [PAWN_possessive] pack back on Avalon. Being a smaller, more tribal pack, they worked mostly alone. [PAWN_nameDef] was often completely swamped with tasks, because even though the pack was fairly small (to Avali standards, anyway), [PAWN_nameDef] still had many tasks to do. [PAWN_pronoun] could never seem to get a break. One day, after another "lost my PDA in the snow" report, [PAWN_nameDef] snapped, leaving the town and taking all [PAWN_possessive] gear with [PAWN_objective]. Soon, [PAWN_nameDef] heard of a new oppurtunity to get off of Avalon with a small group, and quickly enlisted. They want to be the authority to a pack they truly respect.

They dedicated their entire life to picking up all the skills neccesary to survive, wanting to be the best possible choice. Sadly, [PAWN_pronoun] was called out to duty years before [PAWN_pronoun] anticipated, having been able to only pick up bare minimums. I guess there is no better way to learn then doing it yourself, for real... right?
